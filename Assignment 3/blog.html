			<p>Some words of wisdom.</p>
	      	<p>Hello everyone this is my first blog ever. I never thought that I would be ever doing this but yet here we are. First I'd like to say thank you for stopping by on here it is a pleasure. The main reason why I created this website was just to show most of my website projects that I have created in the past. I have always had a passion for creativity growing up, that is one of my main moviation for starting up a youtube channel. I was always taught by my parents to follow your passion and never do a course or get a job based on money alone, yeah because we can say money is good but it wouldn't be good if you were to choose money over passion would it now? </p>

			<p>Emmanz95 thoughs on video games.</p>
	      	<p>Video games are really reigning in this generation. I personally like video games but a lot of people have a lot to say when it comes to games. Over the years people have been debating wether or not that video games are the cause of violence in the country but not only just the country but all over the world.</p>
